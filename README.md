SympAi - AI-Powered Disease Prediction and Recommendation System
developed by muhammad kasim s

Overview
SympAi is an innovative AI-driven tool designed to predict diseases and provide personalized health recommendations based on symptoms. Leveraging advanced machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, SympAi aims to revolutionize healthcare by offering fast, reliable, and tailored insights.

Key Features
üåü Accurate Disease Prediction: Utilizes the robust Random Forest model optimized with GridSearch to achieve high accuracy.
üß¨ Advanced NLP for Symptom Analysis: FastText for effective symptom vectorization and DistilBERT for context-aware recommendations.
üìä Comprehensive Data Processing: Efficient handling of 5000+ records, including demographics and symptoms, with meticulous preprocessing.
üîç Real-Time Insights: Provides real-time, actionable health insights to support healthcare professionals and patients.
Tech Stack
Machine Learning: Random Forest, GridSearch, XGBoost
Natural Language Processing: FastText, DistilBERT
Programming Language: Python (with libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, etc.)
Deployment: Flask (or Streamlit for UI), Docker (optional)
bash

How It Works
Data Preprocessing: Utilizes FastText for converting textual symptoms into word vectors and handles missing values using advanced imputation techniques.
Model Training: Random Forest classifier is optimized with GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth, etc.).
Recommendation System: DistilBERT is fine-tuned on medical text to provide personalized, context-aware health advice.
Results
Prediction Accuracy: Achieved 92% accuracy with the Random Forest model.
Recommendation Quality: 85% alignment with expert medical advice.
Performance Metrics: Precision, recall, and F1-score evaluation to validate model performance.
Future Enhancements
Expand the dataset to include more diverse symptoms and conditions.
Integrate more advanced NLP models like GPT-3 for better contextual understanding.
Improve real-time deployment capabilities and user interface.
