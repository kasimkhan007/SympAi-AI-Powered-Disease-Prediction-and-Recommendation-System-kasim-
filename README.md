How It Works

Data Preprocessing: Utilizes FastText for converting textual symptoms into word vectors and handles missing values using advanced imputation techniques.

Model Training: Random Forest classifier is optimized with GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth, etc.).

Recommendation System: DistilBERT is fine-tuned on medical text to provide personalized, context-aware health advice.

Results

Prediction Accuracy: Achieved 99% accuracy with the Random Forest model.

Recommendation Quality: 90% alignment with expert medical advice.

Performance Metrics: Precision, recall, and F1-score evaluation to validate model performance.


Future Enhancements
Expand the dataset to include more diverse symptoms and conditions.
Integrate more advanced NLP models like GPT-3 for better contextual understanding.
Improve real-time deployment capabilities and user interface.
